**_Mutations everywhere?_**

This Friday, our paper on sequencing of normal skin came out. It was a great application of our [shearwater algorithm](../../../2014/02/02/shearwater.html) for accurately detecting subclonal variants.

What was known before was that UV is one of the strongest mutagens we're naturally exposed to. We also knew that skin cancers are riddled with mutations carrying the signature of UV light. What was not known, however, was whether a cell waits until it acquires sufficiently many driver mutations to become cancerous before macroscopically expanding, or whether clonal expansions already occur at pre-cancerous stages.

So Inigo sequenced 234 biopsies from the eyelids of 4 patients, which had been removed as part of cosmetic surgery. The results were shocking - **1/4 of the skin was covered with mutant clones**. These mutations all had the UV mutation signature with a predominance of C>T mutations at a TpC base context. There was an enrichment of non-synonymous mutations in canonical driver genes, leading to an estimated average of 0.27 driver mutations per skin cell. 

Together, it appears that not only skin cells are heavily mutated, but that this also makes a large fraction of skin cells overly proliferative and hence set on their way to become cancerous.
