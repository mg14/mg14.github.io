As I mentioned [earlier](../../../2014/02/01/blog.html), me and my colleagues felt that the scientific publishing system is inefficient. We often send a paper to a journal, get it rejected by the editor, or even worse, after review, make a few changes, reformat the document to adhere to another journal's style, send it to out and go back to start. This process often goes on in multiple rounds and takes up to a year without fundamentally improving a manuscript. This time is wasted. We could use it for doing more useful things. And we're often working on taxpayers' money. Things must change. 

Scientific communication essentially requires three things:

1. A medium to make the work *public*
2. Peer review to ensure quality
3. A system to select what's interesting

At the moment, journals deliver all three things. They format our manuscripts and put publish them online or in print; they organize the review process; they select what they consider relevant. 

### Medium
We don't need publishers. We have the internet to distribute our messages. We have the tools to produce beautiful articles. Think about this blog. It's written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).  (And it looks quite good, doesn't it?) Think about the [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) typesetting system. And there are converters such as [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to convert from and to virtually all formats.

So nothing could stop me, in principle, to publish my next science paper on this blog. Or on my institute's website. Or on the [arXiv](http://www.arxiv.org).

### Peer review
We all hate reviewers. But we need them. They ensure quality. They often make our research better. Andrew Gelman wrote an interesting article about that topic:  [I owe it all to the haters](http://andrewgelman.com/2011/08/01/i_owe_it_all_to/). However, there are two problems with that: 
1. The typical two or three reviewers are a very small sample. You can simply be unlucky and get someone who doesn't like you or your work, or someone who wouldn't admit that he simply doesn't get it. 
2. Review comes before publication. So if you're unlucky you don't get it out *at all*. Go back to start. 

Why not do the following: Publish a first draft, then wait for a few months to receive feedback from other scientists. Comments may be disastrous or not. Make a few improvements and publish an updated version. It could be so easy. 

### Selection
Why do we all want to publish in Nature, Science and Cell? Because everyone reads these journals. Why is that? Because we're lazy and because the editors do a damn good job in selecting interesting manuscripts for those journals.

I think editors should select *good articles*, but not *what is being published*. 

Essentially editors should be bloggers. Each blog entry would be an editorial with a link to an online publication. If the authors permit, their content may even be embedded in those blogs (reformatted using pandoc, get it?). As a policy, they could only blog about content that had been reviewed and commented on by other scientists. 

Authors could inform influential editors about their fresh pieces of work. Editors could invite other scientists to openly review those articles. It would all be a very lean and transparent process. 

A study could also be reported by multiple blogs; the number and credibility of blogs would present an immediate and robust measure of its initial impact. That might also be used by funding bodies to assess the quality of an applicant's most recent research. Because it is the fear to loose funding after publishing in less renowned journals is what stops scientists from breaking out of the vicious cycle of publishing in high impact journals. 

Nature would be the Huffington Post, but better. Our lives would be a lot easier.
