Why blog? At our 2014 team meeting of the [Cancer Genome Project](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/cancergenome/) 
we had a discussion about the scientic publishing system and I realised that journals are rather unidirectional 
communication channel with a rather limited bandwidth. They are oldfashioned.

So I decided to use this blog to comment on papers and other research activities.
