**_Mutated or not mutated?_**

We have recently published a paper in Nature Medicine investigating the whether different parts of breast tumours harbour different mutations. There has been 
much talk about this over the past years, but it was unclear how general such observations where. 

_Why does subclonality matter?_

There are two reasons why it is important to study the composition of a tumour. First, it sheds light on the tumour's recent history, as subclones have more recently emerged than bulk tumour cells. It is thus important to systematically study these phenomena to understand the dynamics of tumour formation. Second, it is important to assess the how representative a single biopsy is for the rest of the tumour cells. If different parts of the tumour harbour totally different cells, sequencing of a single biopsy may miss many of the mutations present in other parts of the tumour.

_What did we observe?_

We have sequenced 303 tumour samples from 50 different patients. We observed that subclonal patterns largely followed spatial patterns, indicating that the expansion of the cancer is accompanied by the acquisition of additional mutations. We found that **in 13/50 cases potentially targetable mutations where confined to only a subset of biopsies**. The data also didn't show clear patterns in terms of the acquisition of common driver mutations. It may thus be that the same mutations may be selected for at both early and late stages of tumourigenesis, but further research is required to elucidate this.
