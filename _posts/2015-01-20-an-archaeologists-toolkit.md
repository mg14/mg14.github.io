title: A molecular archaeologist's toolkit

I recently wrote on the [Sanger Institute's blog](https://sangerinstitute.wordpress.com/2015/01/14/a-molecular-archaeologists-toolkit/) about a [review paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syu081) I co-authored. 

In this paper we have reviewed computational approaches to understand cancer evolution. I called this post *a molecular archaelogist's toolkit*. Why?

Studying cancer genomes is very similar to archaelogy: We are digging through the shards of a genome and want to understand what type of past catastrophes have led to the observed outcome.
The  difference being that the digging is virtual and done by computers. The language is statistical and tools are different algorithms.
